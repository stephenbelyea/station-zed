<p>We go back to the start of the primordial ooze from which the entire James Bond franchise springs forth from. And what an ooze it is! Not only do we discuss the original Casino Royale novel, but we also talk about Ian Flemming and his issues, which bleeds into the issues we have with Bond&#8217;s premiere. Spoiler alert: we find it rough. How rough?? We felt the need for a special trigger warning for this one. That&#8217;s how rough.</p>
<p>Trigger Warning: a more in-depth discussion about misogyny, violence against women and sexual assault than our usual episodes.</p>

<p>With the news that No Time to Die has been delayed (for the second time) Keegan and Chris take a moment to actually talk about their thoughts on Daniel Craig&#8217;s overdue upcoming Bond finale, as well as it&#8217;s troubling journey to actually be shown to the public during a global pandemic. As if that topic isn&#8217;t fun enough, we also play 2 Bond-themed games: a return to Mad-Libs and a horrible Bond movie review quiz!</p>

      <googleplay:description><![CDATA[With the news that No Time to Die has been delayed (for the second time) Keegan and Chris take a moment to actually talk about their thoughts on Daniel Craig&#8217;s overdue upcoming Bond finale, as well as it&#8217;s troubling journey to actually be shown to the public during a global pandemic. As if that topic isn&#8217;t fun enough, we also play 2 Bond-themed games: a return to Mad-Libs and a horrible Bond movie review quiz!

<p>At long last, we return to the world on James Bond! And boy are we cranky, boarding on nihilistic, as we watch &#8220;Octopussy&#8221; (1983). How can the Boozing &amp; Bonding Boys get mad at a film where James Bond dresses as a clown, gorilla, crocodile, and a horse&#8217;s ass?! Grab yourself a Chai Martini, touch some Fabergé eggs, and join us to find out! #ElephantsNeverForget</p>

<p>Pack your bags folks! It&#8217;s time to blast off with Roger Moore&#8217;s 1979 Bond film Moonraker!! So grab your Tang and vodka, and get Astro-drunk with Keegan and Chris as they navigate the most cartoony of Bond&#8217;s outings. It&#8217;s a film where laser fights fit right in with a hovercraft gondola, a double-taking pigeon, and the most farfetched thing, love at first sight. Also, Jaws is back! Yay!</p>

<p>Roger Moore returns, and his Bond is at peak asshole in the 1974 film The Man with the Golden Gun! Listen as we gush about Christopher Lee, be charmed by Nick Nack, be confused about the film&#8217;s Asian representation, and rage over a poorly placed slide whistle. A couple of tropical &#8220;Golden Gun&#8221; cocktails help us take both good and the bad, so join us for the ups and downs of this perfectly serviceable film.</p>

<p>We jump into some familiar waters as we watch Thunderball and drink the rum-based cocktail known as &#8220;Sharkbite.&#8221; The movie recap gets incredibly sloppy as our drunken ramblings find it difficult to separate this film from Never Say Never Again, and we pitch some new James Bond spin-off movies. 4 episodes in, and we&#8217;re already jumping the shark??

<p>The moment you have all been waiting for&#8230; Fisticuffs Slamdown 2! The legally distinct Royal Rumble knockoff returns with some enhancements. 24 Women (and some fish) will compete for the Wrestle Daddies Women&#8217;s Championship (now the Google World Championship) surrounded by an electrified steel cage and a moat full of surly fish. Will Scarlett Charlotte Chode overcome the odds and defend her title? Or will a newcomer like Sister Sinister overthrow her? Tune in!</p>

<p>The Wrestle Daddies Summer Road Trip is winding to a close. Mostly out of necessity as their latest wrong turn has sent them to the bottom of the ocean &#8211; Atlantis. Luckily their recent business investments in Atlantis and their previous establishment of the Atlantean Championship has fostered a wrestling culture in the deep sea city. Unfortunately as their new fishy friend, Fin, points out &#8211; that&#8217;s about all it has fostered.</p>
<p>Also our special guest this week has a brand new show here on Station Zed! Do you like James Bond? Do you like the occasional martini or ten? Check out Boozing &#038; Bonding, the new podcast where Chris and Keegan pair drinks with James Bond films and review them while they descend into drunkenness. <a href="https://www.stationzed.com/boozing-and-bonding/">Here on Station Zed</a>.</p>

<p>The Wrestle Daddies start their cross-country summer tour as they seek out the brightest minds of the wrestling business to study under. First stop &#8211; Brett&#8217;s hotel. Brett grabbed Sid Crosby, a limo driver from the hotel who has an edgy guerrilla wrestling promotion with some major history &#8211; Wrestling Company (Going For a Long Time). And no he is not that Sid Crosby, but he&#8217;d be a very good wrestler too.</p>

The Wrestle Daddies record way past their bedtime and it leads to the most openings we&#8217;ve had on the show so far. But it also leads to a shocking revelation &#8211; We&#8217;ve never talked about T-shirts. We make up for lost time and pump out all the merchandise we missed out on. Also Brett defends his title in a Great British Bake Off because he hates wrestling.

<p>O Canada! The Daddies are finally back home&#8230; but no rest for the wicked. Ace Lawyer Craig Mazerolle and his friend Can Con have threatened to pull all of Wrestle Daddies sweet sweet grant funding unless they can make the show more Canadian. So strap on your hockey bag and douse your chest hair with sweet, sticky maple syrup as we embrace our Roots (TM) and get all Canuck on y&#8217;all.</p>

<p>Oh boy, the Wrestle Daddies are in quite a downhill jam this week! While wrapping up the matches set up from last week, Brett informs Jake that he has become obsessed with the 2018 Olympic Winter Games and will only defend his title in PyeongChang&#8230; in the Downhill Slope event. The Daddies are heading to the Big Games! And they are bringing their newest legally distinct knock off stable with them.</p>

<p>Shameful. Absolutely shameful. The Wrestle Daddies title scene undergoes some controversy when the champion is forced to reveal a humiliating secret. Perhaps we will redeem ourselves with a clean Fatal 4-Way in the main event? No. Also shameful. The Daddies channel their inner late-era WCW and book their dustiest card yet. Also we repackage Bray Wyatt as a Sex God.</p>

<p>This is not Wrestle Daddies! Okay? So stop thinking that. Uncle Jake is being sued by too many different people, and legally speaking we can&#8217;t be the Wrestle Daddies until this court case is over. So Brett, I mean Bort, I mean Some Guy, has joined us on the show. It&#8217;s your favourite Wrestling Uncles show! Nothing to do with Wrestle Daddies though.</p>

<p>We finally managed to get the two Wrestle Daddies in the same room together and boy oh boy do they have some scores to settle. After branching off with two new shows over the past few weeks, Jake invites Bort Bones onto his new show Beyond Wrestling to replace his two former co-hosts, R.D. Steele and JOHn. Tensions boil and truth reigns/rains this week on Wrestle Daddies.</p>

      <googleplay:description><![CDATA[We finally managed to get the two Wrestle Daddies in the same room together and boy oh boy do they have some scores to settle. After branching off with two new shows over the past few weeks, Jake invites Bort Bones onto his new show Beyond Wrestling to replace his two former co-hosts, R.D. Steele and JOHn. Tensions boil and truth reigns/rains this week on Wrestle Daddies.

One thing is for sure, we will always remember our dinner with Lauren.</p>

<p>Altavista&#8217;s brand new streaming service is off to a bombastic start as Brett is left to build the start of an amusement park by himself. Meanwhile, Gary Oldman has gone missing and both Wrestle Daddies are called into the ring to entertain the masses. Also, nobody tell Food Network about our new show. Please.</p>
