<p>The Wrestle Daddies Summer Road Trip is winding to a close. Mostly out of necessity as their latest wrong turn has sent them to the bottom of the ocean &#8211; Atlantis. Luckily their recent business investments in Atlantis and their previous establishment of the Atlantean Championship has fostered a wrestling culture in the deep sea city. Unfortunately as their new fishy friend, Fin, points out &#8211; that&#8217;s about all it has fostered.</p>
<p>Also our special guest this week has a brand new show here on Station Zed! Do you like James Bond? Do you like the occasional martini or ten? Check out Boozing &#038; Bonding, the new podcast where Chris and Keegan pair drinks with James Bond films and review them while they descend into drunkenness. <a href="https://www.stationzed.com/boozing-and-bonding/">Here on Station Zed</a>.</p>

And no he is not that Sid Crosby, but he&#8217;d be a very good wrestler too.</p>

<p>O Canada! The Daddies are finally back home&#8230; but no rest for the wicked. Ace Lawyer Craig Mazerolle and his friend Can Con have threatened to pull all of Wrestle Daddies sweet sweet grant funding unless they can make the show more Canadian. So strap on your hockey bag and douse your chest hair with sweet, sticky maple syrup as we embrace our Roots (TM) and get all Canuck on y&#8217;all.</p>
<p>Also a special pitch for Station Zed&#8217;s new podcast &#8216;Springfield: The Later Years&#8217;, a podcast where Craig and Pat (of The Dust Off) are two diehard Simpsons fans forced (by themselves) to dive into the controversial later seasons of the show they hold so dear. They already have a slew of episodes waiting just for you right <a href="https://www.stationzed.com/springfield-the-later-years/">here</a>.</p>

      <googleplay:description><![CDATA[O Canada! The Daddies are finally back home&#8230; but no rest for the wicked. Ace Lawyer Craig Mazerolle and his friend Can Con have threatened to pull all of Wrestle Daddies sweet sweet grant funding unless they can make the show more Canadian. So strap on your hockey bag and douse your chest hair with sweet, sticky maple syrup as we embrace our Roots (TM) and get all Canuck on y&#8217;all.
Also a special pitch for Station Zed&#8217;s new podcast &#8216;Springfield: The Later Years&#8217;, a podcast where Craig and Pat (of The Dust Off) are two diehard Simpsons fans forced (by themselves) to dive into the controversial later seasons of the show they hold so dear. They already have a slew of episodes waiting just for you right here.

<p>Shameful. Absolutely shameful. The Wrestle Daddies title scene undergoes some controversy when the champion is forced to reveal a humiliating secret. Perhaps we will redeem ourselves with a clean Fatal 4-Way in the main event? No. Also shameful. The Daddies channel their inner late-era WCW and book their dustiest card yet. Also we repackage Bray Wyatt as a Sex God.</p>

<p>This is not Wrestle Daddies! Okay? So stop thinking that. Uncle Jake is being sued by too many different people, and legally speaking we can&#8217;t be the Wrestle Daddies until this court case is over. So Brett, I mean Bort, I mean Some Guy, has joined us on the show. It&#8217;s your favourite Wrestling Uncles show! Nothing to do with Wrestle Daddies though.</p>

<p>We finally managed to get the two Wrestle Daddies in the same room together and boy oh boy do they have some scores to settle.

Tensions boil and truth reigns/rains this week on Wrestle Daddies.</p>

<p>The moment we have been dreading. Food Network CEO Lauren Graham has come over to Brett&#8217;s house for dinner and to meet his lovely family. It would be a nice, cozy winter evening if not for the fact that Ms. Graham has made it very clear that at the end of the night one of the Daddies will be FIRED. One thing is for sure, we will always remember our dinner with Lauren.</p>

<p>Episode 2 &#8211; Hard Heads, Soft Hearts: Meet the Murphys in Welcome to Murphyville 3000</p>
<p>Our Daddies are back to tussle over all genres of boys. Their multimedia empire continues to grow this week as we get to know a family that&#8217;s been through it all, make goofs with visual aides, frantically type in the background, and generally forget to make a wrestling show.</p>
