## Generate JSON feeds from XML

Use the parse command to cycle through each show's XML feed and generate an associated JSON:

```bash
npm run parse
```

This will automatically update the `/json-feeds` files. It shouldn't be needed regularly, but makes for a helpful tool to avoid manually running through each show's XML.
